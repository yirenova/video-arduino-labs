# Arduino Video Labs

This repository contains **Arduino (Arduino IDE) companion code** for my embedded & IoT tutorial videos.

Each demo is a **Lab** identified by a Case ID (e.g., `A0001`).  
Every lab folder includes:
- Source code (Arduino sketch)
- Wiring notes / pin mapping
- BOM (parts list)
- Step-by-step setup & troubleshooting
